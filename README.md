# Sergei-Processing
Scripts for Processing raw Sergei Photos into images we can use for STL generation

This project is a derivative of the Winogradsky Column made by U-M Ph.D Candidate Erica Gardner

## Code Compilation
For simplicity and readability we used Python for this series of scripts. For larger images, this language does not have the performance capabilities like a C++ executable. So we are using [Codon Compiler](https://github.com/exaloop/codon) to compile Python into fast machine code.
